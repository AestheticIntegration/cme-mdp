First of all I'd do a brief tour to the way I organized everything there.

I'm starting imandra in this ("CME") folder. 

* All the model-related things (things that you want to `:load`) are in the "Model" subfolder.  
* Printers andhelpers (things that you want to `:load_ocaml`) are in the "Printers" subfolder. 
* All the toplevel imandra scripts (like `testgen.ml` ones) are all in the "ImandraScripts". 

Also there are a bunch of folders related to binary representation reading/writing -- those are not relevant now.

In order to reproduce the first problem you can just do this:

    :load ImandraScripts/stuck.ml

On my machine it gets stuck at the test case #14 or #22. I've waited for an hour to
make sure it is really really stuck. The culprit is the `lx86cl64` process
eating 99% of the CPU and 537GB of memory. Denis has reported similar behavior
(it was the test case #22 for him).
